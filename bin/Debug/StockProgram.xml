            This is an experimental form, that allows the user to change the colour scheme of the program.
            There are only two colour themes currently: White and Black.
            (In future, I would like to add more settings and more colour themes to the program)
            
            Currently, I will not implement the form as it still needs to be worked on and as I said, it is still experimental.
            After creating a release for the program, I will implement the settings section as a new feature.
