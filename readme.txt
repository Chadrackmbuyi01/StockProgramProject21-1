 Stock Inventory Control Software
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a program created for workers in an Non-profit Organisation, namely the 'Help your neighber' NGO, who deal with inventory and inventory control on a (mostly) daily basis.
This software is intended to relieve the burden of broad and general database software, and provide specialised tools that will help to increase productivity.

Normally, people who make use of database software such as Microsoft Access or Oracle Database, tend to get their work done at a regular pace. 
This would be due to the large and broad range of functionality and tools that come with these software, that although they aim for efficiency of use,
can often become complicated and time consuming to use.
Especially when it comes to calculations, referencing, even data administration. 
Our project however, makes it much easier to view and retrieve data, perform simple as well as more complex calculations, and even deal with data administration.

Thus, with this piece of software we hope to make working with a stock inventories, a bit easier.

 1. Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The installation file will only work on a windows (32 / 64(x86)bit) machine. We haven't thought about branching to other machines yet,
 as that would be outside of our project's scope.
You can install the program to any location, on any drive you choose.

 2. Known Bugs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(I suppose there's not really harmful bugs apparent. 
The program has been tested to make sure it works in a real-world situation. 
However there may be several bugs after new features are added to the program.)

 3. Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This program was created with intention of being incredibly lightweight, and allowing users to access data fast. 
We therefore decided to use SQLite, which allows you to create a local database file for storing relational data that is easily accessible.
Another reason why we used SQLite was because of security purposes. 
Having a local file, rather than files and data stored on a server, gives the user a tad more protection. 
(also, we aren't that advanced in programming to be able to put in security measures for the database.)

Keep in mind that this program is still fantastically basic, and created with the most fundamental functionality we can put into it within a short time frame. 
Though that might give it an edge of being functional rather than complex, it doesn't quite give much to offer yet.
