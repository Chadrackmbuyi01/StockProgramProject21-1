# StockProgramProject21
The new version of the database stock program in C#, for Project 2: Group 21.

We will update and change this version of the database program from here on out as needed, for the rest of the year.

###########################################################################################################

What we still need to do:
1. Finish programming the appropriate database (table) form and methods within the main database section
2. Program the user control, or user registration form, along with its functionality
3. Program the methods that update, delete or basically modify any of data in the Stock database
4. Modify and change the project's seperate forms and sections to work as one program (though this will be done early in order to prevent problems later)
5. Modify and change the program's appearance/user interface to fit the practical user needs and to be attractive to users.
6. Test the entire program for bugs and errors until it is fully working and complete
7. update the program continually (until it is ready to be distributed to a food parcel NGO).
